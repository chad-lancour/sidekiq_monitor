Sidekiq Monitor
===============
Advanced monitoring for Sidekiq

Description
-----------
Sidekiq Monitor offers a detailed UI for monitoring Sidekiq jobs, letting you filter, search, and sort jobs by many attributes, view error backtraces, set job completion metadata, and more.

It lets you:

  * Sort jobs by:
    * Queue
    * Class
    * Queued at time
    * Started at time
    * Duration
    * Status (e.g. queued, running, complete, failed)
  * Filter jobs by:
    * Queue
    * Class
    * Status
  * Set and view metadata for each job:
    * Name - A customizable, human-readable name (e.g. 'Data Import for John Doe')
    * Result - A customizable value describing the job's result (e.g. '{imported\_documents\_count: 241, imported\_contacts_count: 183}')
  * View errors for failed jobs, including a backtrace
  * Easily isolate long-running jobs and failed jobs
  * Retry failed jobs via a button-click

And it looks like this:

It also includes a live, stacked histogram showing the health of each queue:

Sidekiq Monitor stores jobs using ActiveRecord, allowing you to perform complex queries and delete specific collections of jobs:

```ruby
Sidekiq::Monitor::Job.where(queue: 'user_update').where('enqueued_at > ?', 2.days.ago).destroy_all
```

Installation
------------

Add sidekiq_monitor to your Gemfile:

    gem 'sidekiq_monitor'

Install and run the migration:

    rails g sidekiq:monitor:install
    rake db:migrate

Mount it at a customizable path in `routes.rb`:

    mount Sidekiq::Monitor::Engine => '/sidekiq'

Usage
-----

### Setting a Job Name

To set a job's name (which makes the job's representation in the UI more human-readable), define a `self.job_name` method on your worker that takes the same arguments as its `perform` method:

```ruby
class HardWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(user_id)
    puts 'Doing hard work'
  end

  def self.job_name(user_id)
    User.find(user_id).username
  end
end
```

### Setting a Job Result

To set a job's result (which can show what the job accomplished, for example), return a hash from the worker's `perform` method:

```ruby
class HardWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform(user_ids)
    puts 'Doing hard work'
    {
      message: "#{user_ids.length} users processed",
      processed_users_count: user_ids.length
    }
  end
end
```

If you set `:message` as a key of this hash, that value will be displayed in the Result column of jobs tables in the UI. To view the full result hash of a job in the UI, click on the job status button to open up the modal job view.

### Graph

A single histogram will be shown by default in the Graph view, but you can also split the queues into multiple histograms. (This is especially useful if you have a large number of queues and the single histogram has too many bars to be readable.) The keys of this hash are JS regex patterns for matching queues, and the values of the hash will be the titles of each histogram:

```ruby
# config/initializers/sidekiq_monitor.rb
Sidekiq::Monitor.options[:graphs] = {
  'ALL' => 'All',
  'OTHER' => 'Default Priority',
  '_high$' => 'High Priority',
  '_low$' => 'Low Priority'
}
```

`ALL` and `OTHER` are special keys: `ALL` will show all queues and `OTHER` will show all queues that aren't matched by the regex keys.

#### Poll Interval

The UI uses polling to update its data. By default, the polling interval is 3000ms, but you can adjust this like so:

```ruby
# config/initializers/sidekiq_monitor.rb
Sidekiq::Monitor.options[:poll_interval] = 5000
```

#### Number Of Jobs Per Page

The default number of jobs to show per page in the Jobs UI.

```ruby
# config/initializers/sidekiq_monitor.rb
Sidekiq::Monitor.options[:default_per_page] = 50
```

#### Default Selected Queue

The default queue to show in the Queues UI.

```ruby
# config/initializers/sidekiq_monitor.rb
Sidekiq::Monitor.options[:default_queue] = 'superworker'
```

### Authentication

You'll likely want to restrict access to this interface in a production setting. To do this, you can use routing constraints:

#### Devise

Checks a `User` model instance that responds to `admin?`

```ruby
constraint = lambda { |request| request.env["warden"].authenticate? and request.env['warden'].user.admin? }
constraints constraint do
  mount Sidekiq::Monitor::Engine => '/sidekiq'
end
```

Allow any authenticated `User`

```ruby
constraint = lambda { |request| request.env['warden'].authenticate!({ scope: :user }) }
constraints constraint do
  mount Sidekiq::Monitor::Engine => '/sidekiq'
end
```

Short version

```ruby
authenticate :user do
  mount Sidekiq::Monitor::Engine => '/sidekiq'
end
```

#### Authlogic

```ruby
# lib/admin_constraint.rb
class AdminConstraint
  def matches?(request)
    return false unless request.cookies['user_credentials'].present?
    user = User.find_by_persistence_token(request.cookies['user_credentials'].split(':')[0])
    user && user.admin?
  end
end

# config/routes.rb
require "admin_constraint"
mount Sidekiq::Monitor::Engine => '/sidekiq', :constraints => AdminConstraint.new
```

#### Restful Authentication

Checks a `User` model instance that responds to `admin?`

```
# lib/admin_constraint.rb
class AdminConstraint
  def matches?(request)
    return false unless request.session[:user_id]
    user = User.find request.session[:user_id]
    user && user.admin?
  end
end

# config/routes.rb
require "admin_constraint"
mount Sidekiq::Monitor::Engine => '/sidekiq', :constraints => AdminConstraint.new
```

#### Custom External Authentication

```ruby
class AuthConstraint
  def self.admin?(request)
    return false unless (cookie = request.cookies['auth'])

    Rails.cache.fetch(cookie['user'], :expires_in => 1.minute) do
      auth_data = JSON.parse(Base64.decode64(cookie['data']))
      response = HTTParty.post(Auth.validate_url, :query => auth_data)

      response.code == 200 && JSON.parse(response.body)['roles'].to_a.include?('Admin')
    end
  end
end

# config/routes.rb
constraints lambda {|request| AuthConstraint.admin?(request) } do
  mount Sidekiq::Monitor::Engine => '/admin/sidekiq'
end
```
